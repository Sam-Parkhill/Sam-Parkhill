- Hello, I am @Sam-Parkhill.
- My interest is in data analytics, more specifically the process of raw data being formed into a digestible resource for business decisions.
- Currently i am learning SQL, Python and more advanced Excel, however I hope to be exposed to even more industry tools.
- I am eager to improve upon my skills and have a positive effect within a company allowing me and others to grow.
